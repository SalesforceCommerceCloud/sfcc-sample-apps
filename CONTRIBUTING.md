# Contributing to sfcc-sample-apps

To contribute to sfcc-sample-apps, follow the guidelines below. This helps us address your pull request in a more timely manner. 

## Submitting Your First Pull Request
If this is your first pull request:

  1. Create a fork of the sfcc-sample-apps repository 

  2. Download the forked repository

  3. Checkout the master branch

  4. Apply your code fix

  5. Create a pull request against the master branch

## Submitting a Pull Request
  1. Create a branch off the master branch.

       * To reduce merge conflicts, squash and rebase your branch before submitting your pull request.
   
       * If applicable, reference the issue number in the comments of your pull request.
   
  2. In your pull request, include:

       * A brief description of the problem and your solution
       
       * Steps to reproduce
   
       * Screen shots
   
       * Error logs
   
  3. Grant sfcc-sample-apps team members access to your fork so we can run an automated test on your pull request prior to merging it into our master branch.

       * From within your forked repository, find the 'Settings' link (see the site navigation on left of the page).
   
       * Under the settings menu, click 'User and group access'.
   
       * Add the new user to the input field under the heading 'Users' and give the new user write access.
   
  4. Indicate if there is any data that needs to be included with your code submission. 

  5. Your code should build and pass any tests including linting.

       * Lint your code:  
         `yarn lint` 	 
       * Run and pass the unit test:  
         `yarn test`
  6. Monitor your pull requests.
       
       * Please respond in a timely manner to any comments or questions about your requested changes.
       
       * We may close abandoned pull requests.

## What to Expect

After you submit your pull request, we'll look it over and consider it for merging.

As long as your submission has met the above guidelines, we should merge it in a timely manner. However, please keep the following points in mind:

* All User Experience (UX) changes must be approved by our UX team.
* All documentation or UI text changes must be approved by our Content Experience team.

Our sprints run for about two weeks. In that period of time, we typically review all pull requests, give feedback, and merge the requests (depending on our current sprint priorities).
